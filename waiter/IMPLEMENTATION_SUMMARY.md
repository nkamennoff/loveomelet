   - Updated README.md with project information, setup instructions, and next steps

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Install Required Packages**
   ```bash
   npm install @nuxtjs/i18n

   - About page
   - How It Works detailed page
   - FAQ page
   - User dashboard

3. **Game Setup Flow**
   - Create game creation interface
   - Implement game mode selection
   - Design and implement the tutorial for first-time players

### Medium-Term Tasks

1. **Core Game Mechanics**

3. **Internationalization**
   - Always add new text to both English and French translation files
   - Use translation keys instead of hardcoded text
   - Test the application in both languages

4. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for components
   - Test user flows end-to-end
   - Verify multilingual functionality

## Conclusion

The foundation for the Loveomelet project has been established. The project structure, basic UI, and multilingual support are in place. The detailed task list in TASKS.md provides a roadmap for completing the implementation of all required features.

The next major focus areas should be:
1. Setting up the authentication system
2. Implementing the core game mechanics
3. Creating the user dashboard and game interface

By following the implementation plan and guidelines, the Loveomelet project can be successfully developed into a fully functional SaaS application that helps couples create memorable experiences together.
